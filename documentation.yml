  - name: WebSocket and Rx Streams Interface
    description: |
      Client interface to connect to all SPDZ Proxies using web sockets. Returns [bacon.js](https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js) reactive streams.
    children:
      - connectToSpdzProxyPromise
      - connectToSpdzPartyPromise
      - sendSecretInputsPromise
      - sendClearInputsPromise
      - disconnectFromSpdzPartyPromise   
  - name: REST client interface
    description: |
      Client interface to connect to all SPDZ Proxies using a REST interface.

      These functions use `fetch` which may require a polyfill to be installed by the calling application.

      Browser applications are suggested to use `require('whatwg-fetch')` which is included by default with create-react-app. Native fetch may be available in the browser.

      Node applications are suggested to use `require('isomorphic-fetch')` which pulls in `node-fetch`. Node needs the polyfill.
      
      A promise polyfill is already included.

  - name: Crypto functions
    description: |
      Provide cryptographic functions to manage keys and encryption between client and SPDZ.
      Note that the crypto functions use libsodium with [restricted browser support](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium.js).
